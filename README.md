## ê•¥ Current/Future Projects ê•¥
I keep most of my current personal project repositories private during development but I'm more than happy to share info about them  
Some have not been updated in a while unfortunately but I hope that will change soon as I gain more free time

### 1. Collaborative Trip Planner
My senior design capstone project.  
I, along with 5 other individuals, will develop an application that will streamline planning. Name is a work in progress.

### 2. Discord Bots ![Discord](https://img.shields.io/badge/Discord-%237289DA.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=discord&logoColor=white)
#### My General Purpose Bot
This bot was started back in 2019 and will probably continuously be in development for now. I use it for myself to learn the framework and will continue adding new features to it to apply my knowledge.  
Right now it is written in discord.py, but I have plans to later convert it to discord.js.  
I plan on starting development on another discord bot, but that probably won't be for a while. I'd like to finish some projects first before I add another one.

### 3. Chat Application ![React](https://img.shields.io/badge/react-%2320232a.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=react&logoColor=%2361DAFB)![MongoDB](https://img.shields.io/badge/MongoDB-%234ea94b.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=mongodb&logoColor=white)![Socket.io](https://img.shields.io/badge/Socket.io-black?style=for-the-badge&logo=socket.io&badgeColor=010101)
A pretty basic chat application made with React and MongoDB. This is so I can learn how sockets work, as well as see how message encryption is done.

### 4. Who's That Pokemon? An AI Guessing Game ![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3670A0?style=for-the-badge&logo=python&logoColor=ffdd54)
This is something I've been excited to work on. A user draws a Pokemon on a given canvas and an AI will try and guess which one it is.  
I've already created a classification model using python, but I'm currently figuring out how to create the canvas and connect the frontend to the API.

## ê•¥ Bio ê•¥
Because I've grown up in a rough environment, I've been exposed to technology and internet since from a young age and have consistently stuck to it since then.   

From playing video games to building robots and learning hardware in high school, technology has been the only thing I've really been interested in, which eventually led to me pursuing a computer science degree at UCF. I eventually also decided to pursue a math minor to compliment it.  

I'm highly interested in subjects such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, cybersecurity, and hardware.

At the time, the only CS related AP course available in high school was AP Computer Science Principles. At the end of the year (which was my senior year), I decided to take on a self-proclaimed "senior project" for the teacher who taught it who coincidentally had also been my math teacher for the 3-4 years I've been in high school. This was totally different than the stuff you had to create for the AP exam, this was something I was making on my own time.  
I combined my love of Pokemon and created a very elaborate joke for my teacher as a good bye present. It's a pokemon battle except he is the opponent you must defeat (and there are no pokemon.) [If you'd like to play it, here it is.](https://studio.code.org/projects/applab/vVzvFUNDqaotgtdlGC2EFW7PoHJ6gFpZkMsGiW9g4oc) Be warned that it's very buggy, has a lot of spaghetti code, and is probably cringy to go through. I'm still proud of it though, and I hope to create a sequel around the time I graduate from college ðŸ˜ˆðŸ˜ˆðŸ˜ˆ he'll never see it coming (but I also thought it'd be a cool way to showcase the knowledge I learned. Also I find it very funny)  

Non-academic wise, I enjoy drawing, reading, and playing video games. Sometimes I sew clothes, but I'm not that great at it.  

My all time favorite games are 'The World Ends With You' and 'Splatoon.' My favorite movies are 'Spirited Away,' 'The Secret World of Arrietty,' and 'Kiki's Delivery Service' (though any Studio Ghibli movie is fair game), and my favorite book/series is 'A Thousand Splendid Suns' and the Percy Jackson series.
